//Some type practice without seen  on the keybord
//practice makes perfect, thata wellknown  quota from somewhere so whenever you gets the time the we will dicuss about it , it's really hard to make this kinda improvement within a few days.But patience is everything for a programmer. It does not matter whether you have astrong foundation in programming, as much as you practice ,you will be effecient gradually.Today after given the hrs test ,I was curiuos about the war,history and mythology,mostly the so called stories of Ramayana,Mahabharat.What will be the timeline of this events, some blogs suggest as 35000 years old,some have propesed that 5000 B.C. What is the truth about , didn't find out still now . no wonder we are still live in the era where lots of thing remain to be undiscovered. I have a science baackground, and I don't even knnow why I am writing this kind of stuffs, still better to do something

//but you have to use your all fingers at the smae time, otherwise their will be no  usw of leraning code , create your own cde examples for learning purpos, within this 15 days you could be the master in front end technologie s and web develpment at the same time but you just missed your chance, so what you want to do in this case, //* then do practice you little idiot,dog, pig and what more i can say about this , remember this lessions , you are not someone who don't  have previous experience in coding, you already done internships , and have a good hands on experience with development and coding related stuffs, but you need too much practice, therefore when you achievd something you should be proud of yourself.
